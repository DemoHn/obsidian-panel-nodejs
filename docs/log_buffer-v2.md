**NOTE**: The term `log buffer` refers to the output log generated by MC Server. Differs from bare text, it is formated with additional information.

Log buffer structure:

   0      1  2  3  4  5     6          7 - N
+------+-----------------+-----+------  ...  ------+
|  PTL |    BUF LENGTH   | TYP |     LOG BUFFER    |
+------+-----------------+-----+------  ...  ------+

** PTL = '1' **

a. BUF_LENGTH [5 BIT]: indicates the total length of the buffer. Headers are not included.
This is a 5-bit DIGITT. For example, "05555" means length = 5555.

**NOTE**: The maximum number of buf is 99999. Exceeded bits will be trimmed for safety reasons.

b. PTL [1 BIT]: indicates the Protocol ID. _current value : '1'_


d. INST_ID [2 BIT]: indicates the instance ID.

e. TYP [1 BIT]: indicates the type of log buffer. This value is to classify the origin of log.
   'I': INPUT (stdin)
   'O': OUTPUT (stdout)
   'E': ERROR (stderr)

f. LOG BUFFER [N BIT]: the main content of log buffer. Log buffer is encoded.
